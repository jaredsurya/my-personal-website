            <h2>Freely, Flowingly, Fruitfully</h2>
            <p>The dancers above are in a free-form movement experience called "<a href ="http://www.ecstaticdance.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecstatic Dance</a>."
            They are looking to altar their experience of being, through movement alone.
            As much of a social experience as spiritual, many come to Ecstatic Dance ritually
            and appreciate the lasting effects it causes. Some celebrate bliss. Others, healing. 
            The multitudes of people who practice this endeavor report profound changes to their 
            psyche, and freedom of spirit - upliftedness.

            <h2>Coming Together</h2>
            <p>Each week that Dance is hosted, a new opportunity arises. Whether it's for fun, social connection,
            spiritual union, or exercise, uniting under a common roof (or sky) is a powerful aspect. In a space
            where senses unite to merge overlay into melded experience, one has to reflect on where their journey
            is leading them. With the courage to step ourtside the box, one might find that they are a little more 
            "connected" to their surroundings than they are used to.
            </p>
            <p>With the pulsing beats and stamping feets, each individual dancer seems a part of one 
            inescapable whole. Melding all parts of themself, they are drawn to recognize just how "together"
            they and the dancers surrounding them have been.

        <h2>Why Attend Ecstatic Dance?</h2>
        <p>
            A growing number of people are encountering dissatisfaction within their daily lives. Routine leaves some 
            with an emptiness. Some part of them is not being nurtured. Sometimes, in seeking fulfillment, one might venture
            for some socially satisfying stimulation. Some may seek exercise. Ecstatic Dance offers both. By hosting physical activity
            in a group setting, Ecstatic Dance creates an opportunity for wholesome social communion under a healthy wholesome pretense.
            As a clean event, the dance asks people to come as they are - leaving drugs and alcohol behind. The dance is permissive of 
            a gamut of expression, but asks that conversation be left to outside of the dance floor. This encourages deepening into the movement 
            as exploratory communication and wonder. Stay to the end and you'll typically hear people profess how wonderfully changed they feel 
            from the experience they've had. Many smiles and hugs are shared, with notions of communal support and reverence for community and togetherness.

        <h2>To Find an Ecstatic Dance:</h2>
        <p>
            To find an Ecstatic Dance around you, you may browse through online listings or find a poster hanging at a local coffee shop. Usually 
            the best way is to search the database on the <a href ="http://www.ecstaticdance.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecstatic Dance</a> webpage. Another way to look-up 
            this experience is to dive into the Facebook event pages near you. Sometimes, if you're lucky or serendipitously blessed, some sweet soul 
            will introduce you to the wholesome and lively experience. Go confidently, knowing that you will be received lovingly and your experience 
            will be exactly what you need. Trust.

        <h2>Responses to the Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Of the many responses encountered from participants of the Ecstatic Dance experience, some of the most profound are the biological
            and/or metaphysical effects. Feelings of emotional well-being and belonging, optimism, and greater self-worth are some of them. Also, 
            with a depth of engagement can come truly profound revelations into the nature of existence and one's place within that magnificent complexity. 
            Due to the nature of Ecstatic Dance and self-reflection inherent within it, it is natural for one to experience ego transformation and even 
            dissolution. One becomes completely transfixed on a "higher" self, and transcends identity, when letting go into a guided surrender. 
            The DJ, E.D. framework, and its participants all guide and lead toward satisfactory, conscience-transforming, creative, flourishing expansiveness. 
            It all comes together on the dance floor. A significant solution to trouble is to learn to dance.

        <h2>Comparison of Dances</h2>
        <p>
            Like many other dances, Ecstatic Dance involves a lot of movement. Free-flow is how we would describe the nature of movement within the forum here.
            It is unrestricted. There are no steps to adhere to. Rather, movement is encouraged to flow from a deep inner guidance - within the 
            dancers' soul. Because there is no talking, following ones own inner guidance system becomes easier. Typically, the freedom experienced here is cathartic 
            and relieves stuck "energy" within the individuals' system. A feeling of expansiveness abounds. Typically feelings of inner-trust form again. A wisdom 
            is resumed that was once lost to worldly repetitiveness and melancholy. Step by spontaneous step a resilient innocence resumes.

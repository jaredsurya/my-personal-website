        <h2>Freely, Flowingly, Fruitfully</h2>
        <p>The dancers above are in a free-form movement experience called "Ecstatic Dance."
            They are looking to altar their experience of being, through movement alone.
            As much of a social experience as spiritual, many come to Ecstatic Dance ritually
            and appreciate the lasting effects it causes. Some celebrate bliss. Others, healing. 
            The multitudes of people who practice this endeavor report profound changes to their 
            psyche, and freedom of spirit - upliftedness.
        </p>

        <h2>Coming Together</h2>
        <p>Each week that Dance is hosted, a new opportunity arises. Whether it's for fun, social connection,
            spiritual union, or exercise, uniting under a common roof (or sky) is a powerful aspect.

        <h2>Freely, Flowingly, Fruitfully</h2>
        <p>The dancers above are in a free-form movement experience called "<a href ="http://www.ecstaticdance.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecstatic Dance</a>."
            They are looking to altar their experience of being, through movement alone.
            As much of a social experience as spiritual, many come to Ecstatic Dance ritually
            and appreciate the lasting effects it causes. Some celebrate bliss. Others, healing. 
            The multitudes of people who practice this endeavor report profound changes to their 
            psyche, and freedom of spirit - upliftedness.

    <div id="unite">
        <h2>Coming Together</h2>
        <p>Each week that Dance is hosted, a new opportunity arises. Whether it's for fun, social connection,
            spiritual union, or exercise, uniting under a common roof (or sky) is a powerful aspect. In a space
            where senses unite to merge overlay into melded experience, one has to reflect on where their journey
            is leading them. With the courage to step ourtside the box, one might find that they are a little more 
            "connected" to their surroundings than they are used to.
        </p>
        <p>With the pulsing beats and stamping feets, each individual dancer seems a part of one 
            inescapable whole. Melding all parts of themself, they are drawn to recognize just how "together"
            they and the dancers surrounding them have been.
        </p>

    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why Attend Ecstatic Dance?</h2>
        <p>
            A growing number of people are encountering dissatisfaction within their daily lives. Routine leaves some 
            with an emptiness. Some part of them is not being nurtured. Sometimes, in seeking fulfillment, one might venture
            for some socially satisfying stimulation. Some may seek exercise. Ecstatic Dance offers both. By hosting physical activity
            in a group setting, Ecstatic Dance creates an opportunity for wholesome social communion under a healthy wholesome pretense.
            As a clean event, the dance asks people to come as they are - leaving drugs and alcohol behind. The dance is permissive of 
            a gamut of expression, but asks that conversation be left to outside of the dance floor. This encourages deepening into the movement 
            as exploratory communication and wonder. Stay to the end and you'll typically hear people profess how wonderfully changed they feel 
            from the experience they've had. Many smiles and hugs are shared, with notions of communal support and reverence for community and togetherness.

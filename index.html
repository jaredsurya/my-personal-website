    <h1>To Dance Ecstatic</h1>

        <h2>Freely, Flowingly, Fruitfully</h2>
        <p>The dancers above are in a free-form movement experience called "<a href ="http://www.ecstaticdance.org">Ecstatic Dance</a>."
            They are looking to altar their experience of being, through movement alone.
            As much of a social experience as spiritual, many come to Ecstatic Dance ritually
            and appreciate the lasting effects it causes. Some celebrate bliss. Others, healing. 
            The multitudes of people who practice this endeavor report profound changes to their 
            psyche, and freedom of spirit - upliftedness.
        </p>

        <h2>Coming Together</h2>
        <p>Each week that Dance is hosted, a new opportunity arises. Whether it's for fun, social connection,
            spiritual union, or exercise, uniting under a common roof (or sky) is a powerful aspect. In a space
            where senses unite to merge overlay into melded experience, one has to reflect on where their journey
            is leading them. With the courage to step ourtside the box, one might find that they are a little more 
            "connected" to their surroundings than they are used to.
        </p>
        <p>With the pulsing beats and stamping feets, each individual dancer seems a part of one 
            inescapable whole. Melding all parts of themself, they are drawn to recognize just how "together"
            they and the dancers surrounding them have been.
